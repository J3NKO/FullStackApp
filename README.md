This is a quick Inventrory Tracker, really just designed to learn and test my skills in the .net core MVC environment/model!

Still very much in its infancy but this web app has full stack capabilities though yet to be deployable as the instance of the database is connected to my instance of sql server on my local machiine, 
of which I have been querying through SSMS ofcourse!

-Using Razor pages

I took a code first > DB approach with this application using Entity Framework/Migrations. Getting to grips with the package manager console and the .net environment here.

TODO:

Finish of data models

Add a couple more UI features for 'managing stock'
